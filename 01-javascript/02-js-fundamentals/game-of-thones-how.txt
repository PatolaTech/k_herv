1.  Explored the source API
2.  Adapted previous practice project's JQuery code to console.log for one house using a variable in the URL planning to vary it depending on clicked picture
3.  Having obtained the needed information for output via consol.log....
4.  In the JQuery section, created a string of html content that would then be output via innerHTML to a fieldset for presentation
5.  Created html and csss for the four images
6.  Created JQueary that recognized user clicking the images
7.  Spent much time trying to get one click function to work and stil know which image was clicked
8.  Changed to have one click function, but plannned to use the immediately available house number and only have one get and one string builder
9.  Scope prevented that, so repeated almost all JQuery code three times for one per image
10.  Now thinking the scope problem could be solved, partially, by declaring the houseNumber, and outputString variable at the top of the script tag






Below is some code from practice project:

                $('#button').click(function(){
                    console.log("you clicked me");
                    var other= ($('#username'))[0].value;
                    console.log("other is: " + other);
                    var myLogin ="blaurent123";
                    myLogin = other
                })
